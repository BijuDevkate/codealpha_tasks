# 📌 Code Alpha Python Internship – Project Tasks

This repository contains four Python projects completed as part of the Code Alpha Internship Program. Each task demonstrates core Python concepts and real-world problem solving.

## 🔹 Task 1 – Hangman Game
A text-based Hangman game where the user guesses letters to find a hidden word. The game allows 6 wrong attempts and displays the hangman step-by-step as mistakes occur. It uses loops, conditions, lists, and random word selection.

## 🔹 Task 2 – Stock Portfolio Tracker
A simple stock tracker that calculates total investment value. Users enter stock symbols and quantities, and prices are taken from a predefined dictionary. The program displays individual stock values, the total investment, and can save the result to a file.

## 🔹 Task 3 – Task Automation
This script extracts all email addresses from a text file using regular expressions and saves them into another file. It demonstrates file handling, pattern matching, and automation.

## 🔹 Task 4 – Rule-Based Chatbot
A basic chatbot that responds to greetings, common questions, time, date, jokes, and more using predefined rules and conditional logic.

These projects together showcase Python fundamentals such as input/output, loops, functions, dictionaries, file handling, and automation.
